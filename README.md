<!--Overview -->
## Overview

During my time at Google, I delivered value as a back-end engineer through improvements to existing codebases, primarily in Python, as well as added functionality to a new service. While on the BigQuery team, I spent my time re-writing code samples that would help customers manipulate their data through Google Cloud. I was also responsible for writing two new features that were pushed and made public. You can find those samples above as they are on a public repo. On a separate team, I continued to work in Python, however I contributed to the code base by adding functionality and improvements as time went on for this new service.

For security reasons, I will avoid using code snippets from my second team and rely on descriptions.
